    * testing frameworks for preprocessor and template meta-programming
    constructs have been introduced.
    * ample contains typelists and operations for them.
    * ppmpf contains lots of functional-style horizontal pattern generators.
    * ppmpf has high order functions like foldl, foldr, map, zip, zipwith.
    * ppmpf has "lambdas" with placeholders at the preprocessor level.
    * build system has tests for every meta-programming template and  macro
    construct.

    * Just a series of files for the autotools based build system for the
    clause C++ libraries.
    
    * autogen.sh checks whether ltmain.sh can be patched for --as-needed to work
    as expected (known ltmain.sh bug) and applies the patch.
    
    * autogen.sh -d runs everything up to make distcheck provides a series of
    tarballs with the long sha1 hash of the current git rev-parse HEAD and make
    dist follows the same convention.
