odreex is primarily a metaprogramming experiment. Some things are good to go,
others are still being developed or in process of being introduced. Current
focus is on preprocessor constructs. Although the GPLv3+ license is being used,
I should eventually bring in an exception in the spirit of the GCC linking
exception.
