Working on the build system for the libraries, so only noop functionality 
is available for the time being for testing purposes. This is all about some 
very loosely coupled code that gets finally into shape depending on the time I 
have to put on this. Although the GPLv3+ license is being used, I should 
eventually bring in a linking exception in the spirit of the GCC linking
exception. For the time being, nothing is actually ready for general use.
